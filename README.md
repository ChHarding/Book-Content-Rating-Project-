### Common Errors and Fixes
#### API Connection Failure:
Error Message: "API Request failed"
Fix: Check internet connection. Ensure that the API service (Google Books, Open Library) is not down. If using a developer key, verify that it is valid and has not exceeded its usage limits.

#### Unexpected Data Structure from API:
Error Message: "Unexpected data structure received from [API Name]"
Fix: This is likely due to changes in the API's response format. Users should report this issue for further investigation.

#### Image Loading Failure:
Error Message: Printed in the console, not shown to the user directly.
Fix: Verify the internet connection. If the issue persists, the problem might be with the image source or URL format.

#### No Books Found:
Error Message: "No books found with that title."
Fix: Ensure the book title is correctly spelled. Try including the author's name for a more precise search.
